Bck is a plugin that enhances searching in Vim. It puts bits and pieces 
together to make searching a better experience in Vim.

Searching is powered by ack, which needs to be installed first. This plugin
is similar to ack.vim but it brings several improvements:

* You can specify search options using hotkeys which are displayed at the top of the Bck window
* Each search result has an associated hotkey which can be used to view it
* Cursorline is used to highlight the result
* Results are displayed in the Bck window, but are available in the quickfix
window as well

Bck provides a unified way to search in the following locations:

* project - the closest parent dir which contains a .git folder (or .svn, .hg etc., configurable)
* parent dir - relative to the current file
* file - search only in the current file 
* current dir - in Vim's current working directory
* buffers - all listed buffers

Other search options are:

* ignore case / match case
* recursive / non-recursive
* whole word / substring
